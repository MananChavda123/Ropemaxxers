                                                RISC-V SIMULATOR PHASE - 2 

Started writing the code from 5th march: 

5th March 2024
Added a function in the core class for detecting conditional hazards. Also, added two more stages: memory and writeback because for the phase-1 we included them in 
the execute function. We created a new function named one_cycle in the core class and simulated the machine from there.
  
8th March 2024
Memory hazard resolving condition added. A mechanism to count the number of stalls in the data Hazards and conditional hazards itself.And conditional statements are 
added on the basis of these stalls in the one_cycle function.Here, we added one stall so that the memory hazard condition might be resolved and conditional hazard 
will also be resolved .Then added two stalls to data hazard so that this issue might be resolved. 
  
9th March 2024
Added data forwarding condition to main so that the uesr can have choice regarding the execution of the function. In this we have removed the usage of write back 
stage in which the calculation from execution stage has been brought. We took the functioning of write back to execution stage to enable data forwarding.   
Added IPC and stalls count. Added two bit Branch Predictor here the predictor statement is set to true and will change after every two wrong predicition thus leading 
to 100% prediction when the pc cycle count tends to infinity.
