Cache2 Class:
Private Members:
cacheSize: Total size of the cache memory in bytes.
blockSize: Size of each cache block in bytes.
associativity: Number of blocks per set in the cache.
replacement_policy: Boolean flag indicating the chosen replacement policy (true for LRU, false for MRU).
numSets: Number of sets in the cache memory.
cache: 2D vector representing the cache memory, organized as sets and blocks within each set.
Public Members:
accessLatency: Access latency of the cache memory.
memoryAccess: Total number of memory accesses made to the cache.
misses: Total number of cache misses encountered during memory accesses.

(This is equivalent to the previous cache class, just the cache size differs in L2 cache. It is 4 times of L1 cache.)
